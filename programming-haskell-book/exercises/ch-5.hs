-- 1. Using a list comprehension, give an expression that calculates the sum 12 + 22 + ... 1002 of the first one hundred integer squares.
sumComp :: Int
sumComp = sum [ x * x | x <- [1..100]]

-- 2.Suppose that a coordinate grid of size m Ã— n is given by the list of all pairs (x, y) of integers such that
--   Using a list comprehension, define a function grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int,Int)] that returns a coordinate grid of a given size.
--   For example: > grid 1 2 [(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)]

grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int, Int)]
grid x y = [(a, b) | a <- [0..x], b <- [0..y]]

-- 3.Using a list comprehension and the function grid above, define a function square :: Int -> [(Int,Int)] that returns a coordinate square of size n,
--   excluding the diagonal from (0, 0) to (n, n).
--   For example: > square 2 [(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1)]

-- square :: Int -> [(Int,Int)]
-- square

-- 4.In a similar way to the function length, show how the library function replicate :: Int -> a -> [a] that produces a
--   list of identical elements can be defined using a list comprehension. For example: > replicate 3 True [True,True,True]

replicate2 :: Int -> a -> [a]
replicate2 n val = [val | _ <- [1..n]]

-- 5.A triple (x, y, z) of positive integers is Pythagorean if it satisfies the equation x2 + y2 = z2. Using a list comprehension with three generators,
--   define a function pyths :: Int -> [(Int,Int,Int)] that returns the list of all such triples whose components are at most a given limit.
--   For example: > pyths 10 [(3,4,5),(4,3,5),(6,8,10),(8,6,10)]

pyths :: Int -> [(Int,Int,Int)]
pyths n = [(x, y, z) | x <- [1..n],
                       y <- [1..n],
                       z <- [1..n],
                       x^2 + y^2 == z^2]

-- 6.A positive integer is perfect if it equals the sum of all of its factors, excluding the number itself. Using a list comprehension and the function factors,
--   define a function perfects :: Int -> [Int] that returns the list of all perfect numbers up to a given limit. For example: > perfects 500 [6,28,496]

factors :: Int -> [Int]
factors n = [x | x <- [1..n], n `mod` x == 0]

perfects :: Int -> [Int]
perfects n = [x | x <- [1..n], (sum (factors x) - x) == x]


-- 7.Show how the list comprehension [(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [3,4]] with two generators can be re-expressed using two comprehensions with single generators.
--   Hint: nest one comprehension within the other and make use of the library function concat :: [[a]] -> [a].

-- proof :: Bool
-- proof = [(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [3,4]] == [x | x <- [2, 3]]

-- 8.Redefine the function positions using the function find.


positions :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [Int]
-- positions x xs = [i | (x', i) <- zip xs [0..], x == x']
positions x xs = findIndices (==x) xs

-- 9.The scalar product of two lists of integers xs and ys of length n is given by the sum of the products of corresponding
--   integers: In a similar manner to chisqr, show how a list comprehension can be used to define a
--   function scalarproduct :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int that returns the scalar product of two lists. For example: > scalarproduct [1,2,3] [4,5,6] 32

scalarproduct :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int
scalarproduct xs ys = sum [x * y | (x, y) <- zip xs ys]
